Crop and Soil Management System

Overview
The Crop and Soil Management System is a Python-based application designed to assist farmers in optimizing their agricultural practices. By leveraging data on crops, soil types, pests, diseases, and tasks, this system aims to improve productivity, sustainability, and overall farm management. The application is built without a traditional database, using JSON files for data storage to keep it simple and accessible.

Features
Crop Management: Provides detailed information about various crops, including their ideal growing conditions, water requirements, and average yield.
Soil Management: Offers insights into different soil types, their pH levels, nutrient content, and water retention properties to help farmers choose the right soil for their crops.
Pest and Disease Management: Identifies common pests and diseases, their impact on crops, and recommended remedies to mitigate damage and improve crop health.
Task Scheduling: Helps farmers manage their agricultural tasks with features for scheduling, prioritizing, and tracking tasks such as watering, fertilizing, and harvesting.

Data Storage
The application uses JSON files located in the data/ folder to store and retrieve information. This approach eliminates the need for a traditional database, making the system lightweight and easy to manage.
